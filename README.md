# TodoWEB

This web application is supposed to work as a simple TODO-list, there are 2 types of users, superUser has everything enabled and not superUser users couldnÂ´t add, modify or delete task, but they are able to make modification request that should wait until superUser add (or not) to the principal file task.

All of this is information in stored in a DB (files will save as link), generated files are stored in a specific folder, and all users are able to download whatever file they please.

This project was my first attempt on web, i like it.. hope you too

have fun!
